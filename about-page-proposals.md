# About Page Proposals for Vitsoe 606 Catalogue

Three distinct approaches to the About page, each exploring different aspects of the collection and its relationship to the 606 shelving system.

---

## Proposal 1: Design Philosophy & Principles

**Focus:** The curation philosophy and design principles that guide the collection.

### Content Structure

#### Hero Section
- **Title:** "On Good Design"
- **Subtitle:** A brief statement about the relationship between the 606 system and the objects that complement it
- **Quote:** A prominent quote from Dieter Rams or another relevant designer about design principles

#### Core Principles Section
Three main principles (matching the numbered list pattern seen in the preview page):

1. **Function First**
   - Every object serves a purpose beyond decoration
   - Form follows function in the purest sense
   - Examples from the collection (Braun KF 20, tools, etc.)

2. **Precision**
   - Exact measurements, clean lines, careful consideration
   - The relationship between the 606's precision engineering and objects that share this quality
   - Examples: machinist's tools, technical instruments, precision-made ceramics

3. **Timelessness**
   - Design that transcends trends
   - Objects that remain relevant across decades
   - How the 606 system and these objects share a quality of permanence

#### The 606 Connection
- Brief explanation of the Vitsoe 606 Universal Shelving System
- How the modular, precise nature of 606 informs the selection criteria
- The idea that these objects "belong" with 606—not just aesthetically, but philosophically

#### Curation Statement
- What makes an object worthy of inclusion
- The relationship between objects from different eras, categories, and makers
- The collection as a whole representing a coherent design philosophy

#### Closing
- A statement about the ongoing nature of the collection
- Invitation to explore and discover connections

### Visual Approach
- Clean, minimal layout with generous white space
- Large typography for principles
- Selective use of images—one key object per principle
- Numbered list component for the three principles
- Quote component for the hero section

## Proposal 2: Historical Context & System Thinking

**Focus:** The history of the 606 system and how the collection reflects broader design movements and philosophies.

### Content Structure

#### Hero Section
- **Title:** "606 +"
- **Subtitle:** An exploration of objects that share the 606 system's DNA
- **Image:** Historical photo or technical drawing of the 606 system

#### The 606 System
- **History:** When and why the 606 Universal Shelving System was created
- **Design Philosophy:** Dieter Rams' principles applied to furniture
- **Technical Excellence:** Precision engineering, modularity, permanence
- **Legacy:** How 606 has remained relevant for decades

#### Design Movements & Influences
A timeline or thematic exploration of design movements represented in the collection:

- **Bauhaus & Modernism** (Max Bill, functional forms)
- **Post-War Industrial Design** (Dieter Rams era Braun, precision tools)
- **Craft Traditions** (Japanese woodworking, ceramics, hand tools)
- **Swiss Typography & Graphic Design** (grid systems, precision in communication)
- **Contemporary Minimalism** (Super Normal, Industrial Facility)

#### The Collection as System
- How objects from different eras and categories form a coherent whole
- The idea that good design principles are universal and timeless
- Examples of connections between objects (e.g., precision in both a combination square and a Braun product)

#### Why These Objects?
- Each object exemplifies principles shared with 606
- The collection demonstrates that good design transcends categories
- Objects that complement 606 both aesthetically and philosophically

#### Closing
- The collection as a living document of design excellence
- An invitation to see connections and relationships

### Visual Approach
- Timeline or visual flow showing design movements
- Grid layout showing connections between objects
- Historical images mixed with contemporary photography
- Technical drawings or diagrams where relevant
- Modular card components showing different design movements

## Proposal 3: Curation Process & Collection Narrative

**Focus:** The story of how the collection came together and what it represents as a whole.

### Content Structure

#### Hero Section
- **Title:** "A Curated Collection"
- **Subtitle:** Objects selected for their ability to complement the iconic 606 shelving system
- **Statement:** Brief introduction to the collection's purpose

#### The Selection Process
- **Criteria:** What makes an object worthy of inclusion
  - Functional excellence
  - Timeless design
  - Precision and care in making
  - Philosophical alignment with 606 principles
- **Diversity:** Objects from different eras, cultures, and categories
- **Coherence:** How seemingly disparate objects form a unified collection

#### Collection Highlights by Category
Brief exploration of major categories:

- **Tools & Instruments:** Precision, function, permanence
- **Ceramics & Craft:** The maker's hand, material honesty
- **Furniture & Objects:** Form following function, timeless forms
- **Books & Documents:** Design thinking, principles, history
- **Timepieces & Instruments:** Precision, clarity, function

#### The 606 Philosophy
- How the 606 system embodies specific principles
- How each object in the collection reflects these same principles
- The idea that good design is universal and recognizable across categories

#### Object Relationships
- Examples of how objects relate to each other
- Thematic connections (e.g., all objects emphasizing precision, or all showing material honesty)
- How the collection tells a larger story about design

#### About This Catalogue
- The purpose of documenting these objects
- How the catalogue serves as both archive and inspiration
- The ongoing nature of curation

#### Closing
- A statement about the collection's purpose
- Invitation to explore and discover
- Contact or contribution information (if applicable)

### Visual Approach
- Grid of objects organized by category
- Image displays showing relationships between objects
- Minimal cards with category groupings
- Quote components highlighting key principles
- Clean typography emphasizing the narrative flow

## Comparison & Recommendations

### Proposal 1: Design Philosophy & Principles
**Best for:** Users who want to understand the "why" behind the collection
**Tone:** Philosophical, principle-driven
**Complexity:** Medium—requires clear explanation of abstract concepts
**Visual Style:** Minimal, typography-focused, selective imagery

### Proposal 2: Historical Context & System Thinking
**Best for:** Users interested in design history and the 606 system itself
**Tone:** Educational, contextual
**Complexity:** Higher—requires historical knowledge and timeline presentation
**Visual Style:** Rich with historical imagery, timelines, connections

### Proposal 3: Curation Process & Collection Narrative
**Best for:** Users who want to understand the collection as a whole
**Tone:** Narrative, exploratory
**Complexity:** Medium—storytelling approach
**Visual Style:** Object-focused, category groupings, relationship mapping

### Recommendation
**Proposal 1** aligns best with the site's minimalist aesthetic and the numbered principles pattern already established in the preview page. It's the most direct expression of the site's purpose and can be implemented using existing components (NumberedList, Quote, Heading, BodyText).

However, elements from all three proposals could be combined:
- Use Proposal 1's structure and principles
- Include Proposal 2's brief 606 history section
- Incorporate Proposal 3's category highlights as examples

---

## Implementation Notes

All proposals can be implemented using existing components:
- `Heading`, `BodyText`, `Label` for typography
- `NumberedList` for principles
- `Quote` for designer quotes
- `Card` or variations for object highlights
- `Grid` for layouts
- `ImageDisplay` for photography
- `Section` and `Container` for structure
- `Divider` for separation

The About page should maintain the same visual language as the rest of the site: clean, minimal, with generous white space and precise typography.
